        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Mehvish, currently immersed in the fascinating world of technology as a third-year student pursuing my BTech degree at VESIT. With a passion for coding, I've honed my skills in languages like C, Python, and C++. But, my thirst for knowledge knows no bounds; I'm constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my technical prowess and explore new horizons in the digital realm.

            Beyond the screen and keyboard, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a captivating book or indulging in the therapeutic strokes of a paintbrush. Reading and painting serve as my creative outlets, allowing me to unwind and explore different perspectives.

            But wait, there's more to me than just lines of code and strokes of paint! I'm also a professional baker, crafting delectable treats that tantalize the taste buds and bring joy to those around me.
